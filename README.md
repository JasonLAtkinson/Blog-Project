Project Logo

Project Overview
Welcome to the Personal Blog Website project as part of the Udacity Frontend Development program. This project focuses on creating a visually appealing and responsive personal blog website that demonstrates your skills in HTML, CSS, and web design principles. The website is designed to have a user-friendly layout, custom design elements, and a multi-device responsive experience.

Structure
The project emphasizes a clear separation between the structure and design of the website. It includes the following specifications:

CSS Separate From HTML
The structure and design are separated, ensuring that the HTML document contains no design-related attributes.
The main CSS file imports at least three external CSS files, promoting modular and organized styling.
Directories & Files
The project is organized with a directory structure that logically separates files based on pages and functionality.
Links
A well-defined user flow is established on each page, with appropriate links that enhance navigation.
Design
The design of the Personal Blog Website is crafted to be visually engaging and unique. The following design specifications are implemented:

Custom Design
Custom images, layouts, and styling are incorporated to create a distinctive visual identity.
Foundations/Building Blocks
Typography is thoughtfully designed with at least three unique properties for each typography selector, including headers (h1 to h3), paragraph text with bold, italic, and underlined variations, and appropriately styled links.
Colors
A minimum of three colors are used consistently throughout the website to establish a cohesive color scheme.
Components
Various components are integrated into the website design, including images, image captions, buttons, and styled cards.

Responsiveness
The Personal Blog Website is meticulously designed to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices:

Multi-Device Web Design
Pages are crafted to be mobile-friendly and accurately displayed on all display sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.
Chrome DevTools' Device Mode can be utilized to simulate and fine-tune the website's responsiveness.
Quality
The project adheres to high-quality coding standards and practices:

Clear and uniform indentation.
Appropriate use of new lines for block, list, or table elements, with proper indentation for child elements.
